# Kubernetes Workshop
This is a platform workshop that covers the basics of Kubernetes, designed by Nathan Eng. It uses the project from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_o8dwzRlu4. If you are unfamiliar with Kubernetes, I highly recommend watching this video first, it will be all you need to present on this topic.

**Platform lead: you can view some more info on how to present this workshop [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g5rLkefk_uBrqCWMmnSa5JB9Th94NoMH?usp=sharing)**

## Installation
You will need to install several technologies like Docker Desktop and minikube - this is outlined in `Kubernetes Notes.pdf`.

## Files
`Kubernetes Notes.pdf` is a note sheet I made when learning about Kubernetes that you might find helpful and I would recommend sharing it with members after the workshop. It also has a basic walkthrough of how to complete the demo, but I advise watching the video as well.

`Kuberenetes Workshop.pdf` is the slides I made for this demo - they are a bit longer but these should be covered before the live coding because it provides a good foundation. **Note**: the QR code to the GitHub repo will not work - this was for an old repo before we had the bdbiworkshops account :)

`code` directory contains all of the final code.

## Questions
Good luck! If you have any questions you can always reach me at nathaneng89@gmail.com.
